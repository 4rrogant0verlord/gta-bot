# Gta-Bot
##### Supposed to be a bot that simulates a gang war in the GTA:SA map, it's done...but not that I care about it.

## How does it works

1. To start, it puts an owner to each map zone from each county with a random gang of said county.
2. It takes a random county.
3. Then a random gang from the county.
4. Removes the attacker from the pool, and proceeds to choose another gang(victim).
5. Takes a random territory from the victim gang and puts it on the attacker(emulating a victory or something *(didn't put effort into chance fights or anything)*)
6. When each county has **one** owner, they will attack territories on other counties.
7. This will go on until one gang rules the whole map.
